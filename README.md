## Problem

Today, millions of NFTs are created every day from paintings, photos, drawings. However, the creators of these same contents are in some cases harmed, because NFTs of their works are sometimes created without their knowledge.

## Solution

The Art comes to answer this problem by creating a social network that rewards artists by implementing a decentralized and privacy-friendly NFT creation and reward system.

The platform includes 2 types of uses:

- An artist wanting to create a quality NFT from his works.
- A user interested in NFT and artworks in general.

The Art works as follows:
The artists publish their works in the format of classic images (PNG, JPEG, ...) on the blockchain through the platform.

The users can "upvote" the works they consider relevant and thus make them rise in a general classification.

If an image is "upvoted" a certain number of times, an NFT "validated by The Art" is generated and sent to its creator.

## How to Use

*Provide an explanation of your projects features. You can link a demo video here (2 minutes max)*.

## Side-Quests

*Specify the Side Quest names you tried to implement in this project. Provide explanation / links to relevant part of the codes if possible.*
